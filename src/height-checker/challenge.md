# Height Checker

Students are asked to stand in non-decreasing order of heights for an annual
photo.

Return the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students
to be standing in non-decreasing order of height.

Notice that when a group of students is selected they can reorder in any
possible way between themselves and the non selected students remain on their
seats.

## Example
### Example 1
- Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
- Output: 3

```
Explanation:
Current array : [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Target array  : [1,1,1,2,3,4]
On index 2 (0-based) we have 4 vs 1 so we have to move this student.
On index 4 (0-based) we have 1 vs 3 so we have to move this student.
On index 5 (0-based) we have 3 vs 4 so we have to move this student.
```

### Example 2

- Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
- Output: 5

### Example 3

- Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
- Output: 0

### Example 4


- Input: heights = [10,6,6,10,10,9,8,8,3,3,8,2,1,5,1,9,5,2,7,4,7,7]
- Output: 22

## Constraints

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`
